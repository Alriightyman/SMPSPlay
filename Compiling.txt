Compiling Instructions
======================

Requirements
------------
- Git + CMake (for building libraries)
- Compiler:
    - Linux: GCC
    - Windows: MinGW (GCC for Windows) + MSYS or Microsoft Visual Studio

Visual Studio
-------------
1. In the SMPSPlay\ folder, execute "git submodule update --init" to download the "libvgm" submodule.
2. Open the "Visual Studio command prompt" and go to the SMPSPlay\libs\ folder.
   Then execute the "build_libs_VC*.bat" file that matches your version of Visual Studio.
   Notes:
    - In order to build with VC 2005 or VC 2008, you need to edit the GENERATOR line in build_libs_VC2010-*.bat.
    - In order to build with VC 2012 and higher, you need to edit the GENERATOR and TOOLSET lines in build_libs_VC2017-*.bat.
    - You may run both, the Win32 and Win64 .bat files, in order to compile 32 and 64 bit versions of the libraries.
   The .bat files will build the required libraries and install their .h and .lib files into the "install" folder.
3. Open SMPSPlay.dsw (VC6) / SMPSPlay.sln (VC 2010 and higher) and compile.
   Note: In order to build with VC 2005/2008, you will need to convert one of the other projects.
         If you convert from the VC6 project, you have to fix the file names of the linked libraries.

GCC/MinGW
---------
1. In the SMPSPlay/ folder, execute "git submodule update --init" to download the "libvgm" submodule.
2. Go to the SMPSPlay/libs/ folder and run build_libs_GCC.sh.
   The script will build the required libraries and install their .h and .lib files into the "install" folder.
3. Go back to the SMPSPlay/ folder and run "make".
