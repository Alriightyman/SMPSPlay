4 bytes - Signature "SINS" (Smps INStrument library)
1 byte  - Type
	Bit 0 - separate register array (on) / Interleaved Registers/Data (off)
	Bit 4 - Big Endian pointers (on) / Little Endian pointers (off)
1 byte  - Instrument Count
2 bytes - Data Pointer List File Offset [always Little Endian]
2 bytes - Data Pointer Base [Little/Big Endian]
2 bytes - Register Array File Offset (terminated by 00 or 83) [always Little Endian, required if Type bit 0 is set]
4 bytes - reserved, must be 00

Note: The pointer lists can not reference to any data with a lower offsets than themselves.
